### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Passionate about turning ideas into code, I recently graduated with a degree in computer science and am excited to embark on my journey as a full-stack developer. My goal is to leverage my technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving mindset to make a meaningful impact in the world of web development.

Web Development Enthusiast: With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and typescript (JavaScript), I'm eager to dive deep into the world of full-stack development. I've already begun exploring front-end frameworks like [Reactjs] and back-end technologies such as [Nextjs].
